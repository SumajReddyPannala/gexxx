## app description 
Many farmers in India donâ€™t have access to the vast information available on the Internet about crop growing practices, government schemes, market prices and many more. Our project aim is to build a mobile application that will assemble this information from various reputable sources and present it to the user(farmer) in an intuitive way  and that in local languages and a friendly UI for a smooth user interface.
