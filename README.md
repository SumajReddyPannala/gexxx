## app description 
Many farmers in India have little access to extensive internet information on crop production activities, government schemes, market rates and so on. Our goal of our project is to create an app that gathers this information from different reputable sources and presents it intuitively to the user (farmer) and in local languages and a friendly interface for a smooth user interface.
